# General Info
This is an android native Java application from the book The Big Nerd Ranch Guide Android Programming,3rd Edition. The application can be used to record awkward situations (crimes:)) such as faulty parking, indoors smoking etc., then maybe share the crime with people in the phone's contacts list, even with the suspect. 
The project's main targets are
- create fragments instead of activities.
- list crimes using RecyclerView.
- save crime data in SQLite database tables.
- create implicit intents to  connect Camera and Contacts list.

I added the followings to the standard code described in the book
- Dagger framework for Dependency Injection. 
- swipe functionality to delete a crime.
